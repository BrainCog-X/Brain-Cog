# BrainCog

---

BrainCog is an open source spiking neural network based brain-inspired 
cognitive intelligence engine for Brain-inspired Artificial Intelligence and brain simulation. More information on BrainCog can be found on its homepage http://www.brain-cog.network/

The current version of BrainCog contains at least 18 functional spiking neural network algorithms (including but not limited to perception and learning, decision making, knowledge representation and reasoning, motor control, social cognition, etc.) built based on BrainCog infrastructures, and BrainCog also provide brain simulations to drosophila, rodent, monkey, and human brains at multiple scales based on spiking neural networks at multiple scales. More detail in http://www.brain-cog.network/docs/

BrainCog is a community based effort for spiking neural network based artificial intelligence, and we welcome any forms of contributions, from contributing to the development of core components, to contributing for applications.

## Brain-Inspired AI
BrainCog currently provides cognitive functions components that can be classified 
into five categories: 
* Perception and Learning
* Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
* Decision Making
* Motor Control
* Social Cognition
* Development and Evolution
* Safety and Security

## Brain Simulation
BrainCog currently include two parts for brain simulation:
* Brain Cognitive Function Simulation
* Multi-scale Brain Structure Simulation

The anatomical and imaging data is used to support our simulation from various aspects. 

## Software-Hardware Codesign
BrainCog currently provides `hardware acceleration` for spiking neural network based brain-inspired AI.
