# Brain-inspired Decision-Making SNN

## Requirements

"BDM-SNN.py"，"BDM-SNN-hh.py"：pygame

"BDM-SNN-UAV.py"：robomaster


## Run
 The BDM-SNN.py implements the core code of the brain-inspired decision-making spiking neural network in paper entitled "A brain-inspired decision-making spiking neural network and its application in unmanned aerial vehicle".

 "BDM-SNN.py"  includes the multi-brain regions coordinated decision-making spiking neural network with LIF neurons.

 "BDM-SNN-hh.py"  includes the BDM-SNN with simplified HH neurons.

 "BDM-SNN-UAV.py"  includes the BDM-SNN applied to the UAV (DJI Tello talent), users need to define the reinforcement learning task.

```shell
python BDM-SNN.py

python BDM-SNN-hh.py

python BDM-SNN-UAV.py
```

## Results
 "BDM-SNN.py"  and  "BDM-SNN-hh.py"  have been verified on Flappy Bird game. BDM-SNN could stably pass the pipeline on the first try.
