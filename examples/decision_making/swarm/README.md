## Paper Introduction 
The collaborative interaction mechanisms of biological swarms in nature are of great importance to inspire the study of swarm intelligence. This paper proposed a self-organizing obstacle avoidance model by drawing on the decentralized, self-organizing properties of intelligent behavior of biological swarms. Each individual independently adopts brain-inspired reward-modulated spiking neural network (RSNN) to achieve online learning and makes decentralized decisions based on local observations. The following picture shows the decision-making process of our model.

We validated the proposed model on swarm collision avoidance tasks (a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles without central control) in a bounded space, carrying out simulation and real-world experiments. The drone swarm emerges with safe flight behavior, as shown in the following videos. Compared with artificial neural network-based online learning methods, our proposed method exhibits superior performance and better stability.
