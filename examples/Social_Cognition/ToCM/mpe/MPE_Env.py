"""
Code for creating a multiagent environment with one of the scenarios listed
in ./scenarios/.
Can be called by using, for example:
    env = make_env('simple_speaker_listener')
After producing the env object, can be used similarly to an OpenAI gym
environment.

A policy using this environment must output actions in the form of a list
for all agents. Each element of the list should be a numpy array,
of size (env.world.dim_p + env.world.dim_c, 1). Physical actions precede
communication actions in this array. See environment.py for more details.

    Creates a MultiAgentEnv object as env. This can be used similar to a gym
    environment by calling env.reset() and env.step().
    Use env.render() to view the environment on the screen.

        scenario_name   :   name of the scenario from ./scenarios/ to be Returns
