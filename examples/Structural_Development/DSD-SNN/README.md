# Enhancing Efficient Continual Learning with Dynamic Structure Development of Spiking Neural Networks #

## Requirments ##
* numpy
* timm
* pytorch >= 1.7.0
* collections
* argparse

## Introduction ##
Dynamic Structure Development of Spiking Neural Networks (DSD-SNN) for efficient and adaptive continual learning:   

grow new neurons and prune redundant neurons, increasing memory capacity and reducing computational overhead.  

verlap shared structure to leverage acquired knowledge to new tasks, empowering a single network to support multiple incremental tasks.   

We validate the effectiveness of the DSD-SNN multiple TIL and CIL benchmarks.

## Run ##
 

```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_simplified.py```   

Enjoy!
