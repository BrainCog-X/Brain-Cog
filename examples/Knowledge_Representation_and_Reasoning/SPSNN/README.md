#  Sequence Production SNN

This repository contains code from our paper [**Brain Inspired Sequences Production by Spiking Neural Networks With Reward-Modulated STDP**] published in Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience. This module builds a Sequence Production spiking neural network model, realizing the memory and reconstruction functions for arbitrary symbol sequences. The input causal graph is shown in figure causal_graph.png. The input current, spike trains during the learning process and the network weight distribution after the learning are shown in the Results folder.


## Requirments

* numpy
* scipy
* pytorch >= 1.7.0
* torchvision





## Run

```shell
python main.py file
```
